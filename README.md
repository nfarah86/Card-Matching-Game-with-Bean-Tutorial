# Card Matching Game with Bean Tutorial

This is a tutorial based on the first 3 Computer Science CS139p courses [Developing iOS 7 Apps for iPhone and iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/course/developing-ios-7-apps-for/id733644550) by Stanford University on iTunes U. I incorporated Punch Through's [Bean](https://punchthrough.com/bean-from-wireframe), such that when the Bean is shaken very hard, it reshuffles the deck.  I used the Bean's [iOS SDK](https://github.com/PunchThrough/Bean-iOS-OSX-SDK) so that my program knows how to communicate to the Bean. The reference documentation for the SDK can be found [here](https://punchthrough.com/files/bean/sdk-docs/index.html).

To learn how to use the Bean, visit the [Getting started guide](https://www.punchthrough.com/bean/guides/getting-started/intro/)

I used some classes not mentioned in the lectures, which I will go over during the tutorial.
